#  MPI Lattice Boltzmann

An MPI optimisation of a Lattice Boltzmann scheme. Using MPI to allow multiple nodes to work on the simulation in parallel.
* 2D grid
* 9 velocities per grid cell.
* Using Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook collision step

Based on an unoptimised version provided by the UoB-HPC team [Here](https://github.com/UoB-HPC/UoB-HPC-LBM-2016).
